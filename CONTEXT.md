Create a business card design as HTML/CSS, two separate card faces for high-res export.

---

CONTEXT (Use this to influence the design vibe):

Keishi is a 22-year-old software engineer and startup founder based in Hanoi. 

Key adjectives: Pragmatic, Resourceful, Rational, Ambitious, Systems-minded, Analytical, Self-taught, Resilient, Scrappy.

He's a final-year CS student at Vietnam's top tech university, Software Project Leader at Samsung, and co-founding two startups. He grew up with limited resources — learned to fix household appliances as a kid, built his first PC on a mass production budget. He values substance over flash, earned credibility over inherited status.

The card should feel like: "This person builds real things. They're serious but not boring. Technical but approachable. Someone you want to work with."

Reference aesthetic: Linear.app, Vercel, Raycast — sharp, premium, confident. Not corporate stiff. Not startup chaotic.

CARD SPECS:
Size: 90×50mm (scale up 3x for sharp export)

FRONT SIDE (Minimal, Classy):

Layout: Left-aligned text, QR code anchored right

Content:
  Keishi
  Software Engineer & Founder
  
  +84 904 954 246
  phananha4@gmail.com
  Hanoi, Vietnam

Design direction:
- Subtle paper/cream texture background — tactile, warm
- Typography: Clean serif OR elegant monospace, generous letter-spacing
- QR code: Clean square, placeholder is fine (links to portfolio)
- Vibe: Understated confidence. The card of someone who lets work speak for itself. Like a well-made tool — no decoration, just quality.

---

BACK SIDE (Code Signature):

Layout: Centered code block, subtle signature below

Code content:
void keishi(void *challenge) {
    (void)challenge;  // accepted
    bind(email, "phananha4@gmail.com");
    bind(phone, "+84 904 954 246");
    execute();
}

Design direction:
- Dark background (#0d1117 or GitHub dark)
- Syntax highlighting: muted, not rainbow — think Dracula or One Dark
- Font: JetBrains Mono or Fira Code
- Below code: small "KEISHI" as a maker's mark — not handwritten, but like a stamp/brand. Could be monospaced, uppercase, slightly letterspaced.
- Optional: Very subtle grid lines or aura glow around edges — sharp, technical
- Vibe: "I wrote this. I write solutions." The back of the card IS the portfolio.

OUTPUT:
Two card faces, properly proportioned. No borders. Print-ready aesthetic. Make it something Keishi would be proud to hand to a Samsung exec or a startup investor.
